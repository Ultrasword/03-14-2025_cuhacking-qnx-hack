    "context": "The scene takes place in a living room setting. Two men are sitting on a gray couch with throw pillows and a light green blanket.  The main activity is one of the men using a sticker-covered laptop. The other man sits next to him, looking at a different device which appears to be a laptop or keyboard. A small potted tree stands beside the couch. The audio suggests the man using the stickered laptop recently received some disappointing news, potentially a rejection of some kind.  His friend sits beside him.",
